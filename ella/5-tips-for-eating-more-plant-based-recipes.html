year’ mentality, I do believe there is benefit in setting a few small intentions for the upcoming months. When I talk to people about this, something around food always comes up, usually with an emphasis on eating more vegetables. Given that only about 10% of adults in the United States eat the recommended serving of vegetables (according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1116-fruit-vegetable-consumption.html">CDC</a>), it’s a good emphasis to have.</p><p>And so, to start this new year, I thought I’d share five tips to get you on the path to eating more plants (and plant-based recipes). It’s definitely a shift and not every member of your family may be onboard right away. I still get my fair-share of ‘that looks disgusting’ from my toddler. The most important part is trying. If you don’t like something, that’s cool- try something else. If you’re on the fence, try it again but maybe in a different way.</p><p>It took me some time to grow to love many of the vegetables you see all over this site. It was a lot of trial and error but there’s definitely items on my suspect list (I’m lookin’ at you, mushrooms). So, without further preamble, my five tips to help you eat a bit more plant-based.</p></div><h2 id="plantbased-recipes-pantry-pantry-pantry">Plant-Based Recipes: Pantry, Pantry, Pantry</h2><p><img alt="How to Stock a Vegetarian Pantry | @naturallyella" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24769" height="2190" sizes="(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px" src="https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2.jpg" srcset="https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2.jpg 1460w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2-433x650.jpg 433w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2-667x1000.jpg 667w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pantry-2-533x800.jpg 533w" width="1460"/></p><div><p>Somewhere around the house I have a print-out of a cookbook proposal all about the pantry.

The recipes below are the foundation for most meals during the week.</p><h4><a href="https://naturallyella.com/spiced-pinto-beans-cooking-component/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Perfect Pot of Beans</a></h4><p>When it comes to plant-based recipes in our house, there is nothing as seemingly as important as a solid pot of beans. Sure, it’s a bit more involved than buying a can at the grocery store. However, it’s easier to manipulate the flavors to your liking. Of course, if you don’t have time, buying cans of beans can be just as useful.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S9AncTuARXk" width="560"></iframe></p><p><strong>Uses for a perfect pot of beans:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/roasted-pumpkin-polenta/">Polenta topped with beans</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/three-bean-vegan-chili/">Three Bean Chili</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/chickpea-curry-stuffed-pita/">Curried Chickpea Stuffed Pita </a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/pinto-bean-tostadas/">Pinto Bean Tostadas</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/garlicky-bean-toast/">Garlicky Bean Toast</a></li></ul><h4><a href="https://naturallyella.com/cashew-cream/">Cashew/Sunflower Cream Sauce</a></h4><div><p>Cashew cream is one of those recipes that seemingly got a ton of hype in the vegan world but is amazingly useful across any kind of recipe.

When it doubt, cut any vegetable into bite-sized pieces, toss with a bit of oil and salt, then roast at 425˚F until tender and starting to brown. It’s really hard to go wrong and the best part, most vegetables don’t even need to be peeled (except for a few winter squash/celeriac).

What about buying the most lovely carrots with their greens still attached, only to throw away the greens? It doesn’t have to be that way. And the more you work with the entire vegetable, the more comfortable you become knowing how to treat each part.</p><h4>The Whole Vegetable, together</h4><p><strong>Broccoli:</strong> Broccoli stalks are down right delicious, however, if you treat the stalks as you would the florets, you will end up really disappointed. For the stalks, you need to trim the tough ends, peel the tough exterior, and plan to cook the stalks a bit longer than you would the florets. I like to steam the stems and make fritters. Another option is to parboil the stems then roasted along-side the florets. Or, cook in a broccoli soup and puree with the florets.</p><p><strong>Cauliflower:</strong> One of my recent favorite discoveries was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br6O7BhhKm4/">smoking wedges of cauliflowe</a>r (leaves/greens still attached). All parts of the cauliflower are edible and can easily be roasted or grilled along with the florets. There’s no major taste difference and it creates a beautiful presentation.</p><h4>The Vegetable, in parts</h4><p><strong>Beets (and turnips):</strong> One beet can easily provide two different meals. The root is what we’re most familiar with but the greens are edible. They can be a bit bitter sometimes, but I’ve had my best luck adding them to stews or cooking with other hearty greens like kale or chard.</p><p><strong>Carrots:</strong> I like to put carrot tops in the same category as herbs. If parsley can do it, most likely carrot tops will fit right in. Similar to the beets, they can be a bit bitter. And so, I like to pair them with other herbs and stronger flavors. Think pesto, chimichurri, or a lovely gremolata.</p><p>Finally, it pays to save. Save all those vegetable scraps and make stock. I keep a bag in the freezer that I constantly add scraps to. Eventually, when I get enough, I’m able to make a delicious, homemade vegetable stock.</p></div><p> </p><h2 id="jump-into-flavors">Jump into flavors</h2><p><img alt="Coriander | Spices- Stock a Pantry | Naturally Ella" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27746" height="2250" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" src="https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1.jpg" srcset="https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1.jpg 1500w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1-433x650.jpg 433w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1-667x1000.jpg 667w, https://32lxcujgg9-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coriander-1-533x800.jpg 533w" width="1500"/></p><div><p>When it comes to plant-based recipes, I find people shy away from bold flavors. You can season a piece of meat, so why can’t you flavor a piece of cauliflower or sweet potato? In some ways, I think you have more options, more ways to play. Each vegetable is different. Some things work, some things don’t.</p><p>That, however, is the beautiful part of cooking. And so, I urge you to dig into your spice cabinet. Experiment with chili peppers. Use more herbs than you’ve ever used before (this is also a good push to start a small herb garden- they work so well even in pots!)</p><h4>Herbs (and herb sauces)</h4><p>Herbs are your friend. Use them as toppings, blend them into delicious sauces, or add them to cooked vegetables. I’m not talking about a tablespoon or two, either. I’m talking about handfuls. Herbs can help make or break a dish. Try your hand at an herb-based sauce or a heavily-herbed recipe:</p><ul><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/chimichurri-cooking-component/">Chimichurri</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/herby-hemp-sauce/">Herby Hemp Sauce</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/use-up-cilantro-parsley/">17 ways to use up cilantro and parsley</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/herbed-cucumber-salad-with-farro/">Herbed Cucumber Salad</a></li></ul><h4>Spices/Spice Blends</h4><p>So many cultures don’t shy away from bold spice flavors and yet, for many vegetarian/vegan dishes in the United States, they can be so bland. Pull out that coriander, use cinnamon in a savory dish, or try your hand at making homemade spice blends, perfectly suited for roasted vegetables.</p><ul><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/kale-baked-eggs/">Kale Baked Eggs with Dukkah</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/spiced-lentil-stew/">Spiced Lentil Stew</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/zaatar-roasted-tomato-salad/">Za’atar Roasted Tomato Salad</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/spiced-chickpeas/">Spiced Chickpeas</a></li><li><a href="https://naturallyella.com/adobo-acorn-squash-crispy-quinoa-and-jalapeno-chimichurri/">Adobo Roasted Acorn Squash</a></li></ul><h4>Chili Peppers</h4><p>Finally, get to know dried peppers. It doesn’t always have to be heat-driven. Many delicious varieties of dried chili peppers are low on the heat scale. However, they provide just enough zing to complete the meal. Plus, dried chili peppers last quite some time, making them a perfect addition to your pantry.</p></div><p> </p><h2 id="dont-overcomplicate">Don’t Over-Complicate</h2><p><img alt="Overhead shot of cauliflower on a sheet tray, tossed and roasted with mole sauce." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37156" data-pin-description="Roasted Mole Cauliflower (with or without chickpeas).
